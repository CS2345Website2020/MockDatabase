Fish Shambles is an oil on canvas that measures 38 by 52 11/16 inches. The painting was a part of the bequest of the Honorable James Bowdoin III.',
              description_spatial: 'There are three people in this scene. There is a man on the left side of the painting, to the left of a table with a large pile of fish on it. The man seems to be running his fish market stall from this table. He is wearing a red shirt and a matching hat. He is holding a butcher knife in his right hand and has his left hand raised as if he is talking with his hands. He is looking to the right at a young woman. The woman is standing on the right side of the table, directly opposite of the man. She is holding her right hand up towards the pile of fish that sits in the middle of the table. An older woman’s face is barely visible, over the left shoulder of the young woman, at the edge of the right side of the painting. The older woman is observing the conversation between the other two about fish. She appears to be waiting in line to buy fish from this market. In the center of the scene, a very large fish hangs from a hook. It is sliced down the middle of its underside with its entrails spilled open. A smaller fish hangs from a hook just above the large fish and slightly to the left. Many different types and colors of fish are scattered on the table beneath the hanging fish. The fish are painted with a metallic, shiny paint that provides contrast with the much darker areas of the scene to the right and left.',
              description_thematic: 'One definition of the word “shambles” refers to a butcher’s slaughterhouse. The title of this painting suggests that a man holding a butcher knife in the painting is selling fish to his customers. In front of the man, a few coins lay on the table to suggest a recent sale of fish from the display. The man appears to be talking to a woman on the other side of the table about the fish. He is half hidden in the shadows. The brightness of the fish in the center of the scene are in great contrast with dark and stormy colors used for the people and the surrounding background in this painting. The metallic finish used for the fish focuses the viewer’s attention to the fish that are in the foreground of the painting. On the left, a monk fish sits directly in front of the butcher with its jaws spread open, exposing rows of sharp teeth. To the right of the monkfish, a partially gutted striped perch hangs from a hook, shining with its silver and white colors. Continuing to the right of the perch, a cod sits diagonally with its head piercing into the shadows near the right edge of the painting. Although the artist of the painting is unknown, art historians believe that two artists worked on this painting. This method was popular in Italy during the seventeenth-century in Italy, which suggests its country and date of origin.',

Saint Peter is reaching his left arm up towards the angel who is located in the upper right side of the canvas at approximately 2 o’clock. She is looking down at Saint Peter and holding his left arm with her right hand. Saint Peter’s feet have been released, from a chain in the bottom right corner.',
              description_thematic: 'The painting portrays the story told in the Bible in Acts of the Apostles about Saint Peter’s imprisonment by King Herod. Herod persecuted the leadership of the growing Christian Church. The night before Peter’s prosecution, an angel appeared and woke him, removing the chains from his hands. The angel is in a white robe and is standing over Peter. She has red hair and faint wings shadowed behind her shoulders. The angel has a red fabric shawl draped over her right arm and across her body, holding the rest of the fabric in her left hand. Her right hand holds Saint Peter’s left hand representing the moment of the angel freeing Peter from the chains. Peter is wearing a blue tunic and his legs are partially covered by a gold fabric shawl. His left hand reaches up to the angel and his face appears desperate as he waits for her to free him. Peter’s right hand is at the 8 o’clock position and holding a set of keys. The keys symbolize Saint Peter’s ability to bind or loosen souls who are waiting to receive their judgement to enter the kingdom of heaven.',

Allori also painted two other miniature portraits based off this one that currently reside in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence Italy. Allori’s portraits are known for their close adherence to the nature of the subject, their fine detail, and their flawless execution of technique. Allori portraits, such as this one, convey his ability to communicate the subtle range of emotions in his subjects. Traditionally, this portrait was attributed to the Spanish court painter, Diego Velazquez, then later to his son-in-law. It was only properly identified in the Florentine tradition in the late 1980’s when it was confirmed as an Allori portrait and included in a landmark exhibition at the Palazzo Pitti of 17th century art, originating in Florence.',

At the 12 o’clock position, the Madonna is seated on clouds in the center of the top half of the canvas holding the baby Jesus gently on her right leg. She is holding a set of rosary beads in her left hand. At the 2 o’clock position, there is an older, bearded man who is wearing a cloak and holding a staff with a flame on the top.

In the foreground, there is a stampede of animals running out of the painting towards the viewer. On the left edge of the painting there is a goat and three sheep running towards the viewer, off of the left side of the painting . In the center of the painting, a large bull is running towards the viewer and knocking over a table along with all of its contents such as woven baskets and items of food that seem to be a part of a food marketplace. .To the right of the bull, a cow is also running towards the viewer attempting to avoid the items that the bull has knocked off of the table. To the right of the cow, there is a goat with small horns, who is facing the viewer. In the background, on the left edge of the painting, there appears to be the entrance to the temple. There is a man attempting to grab goat and sheep to stop them from running away and an older man clings to the entrance wall. In the center background of the scene, looking into the temple, Christ is shown chasing a group of older men out of the temple. He is facing the left side of the painting holding his right hand in anger threatening the men who are running away from him. In the background, on the right side of the painting, a group of younger men are trying to stay out of the way of the stampeding animals.',

Castiglione makes a visual connection between the stampede of frightened sacrificial animals and the group of merchants and priests fleeing the temple as both groups seem to be frantically running away from an enraged Christ. The scene of the stampede is chaotic and full of commotion and chaos as animals are trampling over objects scattered on the floor and people are trying to get out of the way. The scene of Jesus chasing the temple occupants mirrors the animals as all are running in all directions as Jesus drives all of the scene’s figures out of the temple. Jesus is portrayed as angry over the practice of priests accepting money for making animal sacrifices and letting merchants sell animals inside a holy place.',

This portrait portrays the futile romance between Apollo and Daphne; Apollo is deeply in love with Daphne, a woman who abhors Apollo’s advances. Located in the foreground center, Apollo is dressed in armor reaching out with his right hand towards Daphne's shoulder. As Apollo reaches out to lay his hand on Daphne, her fingers and arms in the left top background begin transforming into tree branches.  In the portrait, we witness the initial instant of Daphne’s transformation branches springing upward from her arms while the rest of her body remains in human form. The look of longing on Apollo’s face is apparent,  both of them appear to still be moving leftward out of the image, as if in mid-chase. The transformative depiction of Daphne signals the end of the chase as she turns into a tree beginning with her hands and the top of her head. Apollo's touch reveals the futility of his desire, as well as the violence and persistence with which he pursued Daphne.",
